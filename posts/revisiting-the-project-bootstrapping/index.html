      <p>Did you know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers">AVR</a> is one microcontroller family that can be programmed by <strong>bit banging by hand</strong>? No computers or USB interfacing required, just plain physical, electrical on-and-offs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.
The in-system programming (ISP) interface of AVR is concise enough that you can write to its flash memory an upwards of 10 to 20 instructions <em>one bit at a time</em>, with a reasonable amount of patience. In comparison, <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/jtag-test-access-port-tap-state-machine/">the JTAG type interface</a> used by ARM and MIPS chips is too fiddly to program by hand, I discovered. Another big factor is that AVR is an 8-bit architecture so the instructions are only 16-bit wide.</p>
<p><img src="attiny85_product.webp" alt="ATtiny85">
<em>ATtiny85 8-bit microcontroller</em></p>
<p>Why would that be useful? It is a mythical tale I tell time to time of when I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping"><em>bootstrapped</em></a> a rudimentary DOS-like operating system 5 years ago over 9 months, starting with a handful of ATtiny85s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bootstrapped&rsquo; meaning I did not use existing software stack to program it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mythical&rsquo; because I did not leave any tangible records of it. The anectodes on this post are all there is of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-project-bootstrapping">The Project Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>It was an exercise that I believed could be described as retracing the history of the development of modern software stack, from assembler to operating systems.
When one starts programming, the existence of a suite of software toolchain and programming environment is taken for granted. But, how was <em>that</em> toolchain made?, it was to be explored.</p>
<p>But I am not sure if that is a valid description of project. First, I was already equipped with some CS knowledge of software stack, so I already knew the end result. No creativity was required like it would have been for the early pioneers of computers. And secondly, I was programming 8-bit microcontrollers which are not general computers.</p>
<p>Nonetheless it was an educational exercise.</p>
<h2 id="its-all-about-stages">It&rsquo;s All About Stages</h2>
<p>Bootstrapping happens in discrete steps with the increasing abilities of making longer programs.</p>
<h3 id="stage-1-one-bit-in-one-bit-out">Stage 1: one bit in, one bit out</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input: a button</li>
<li>Display: an array of 8 LEDs displaying the byte I am pushing in</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first stage described above, only about ~16 instructions could be added to a program before I run out of patience and sanity.
Hand-scribing instructions into binary is tedious enough, what is more punishing is I only have to make one 1-bit mistake and the program is broken.
And there isn&rsquo;t a way to debug it.</p>
<p>A 16-instruction program cannot do much. What it can do is, you can put together a few of these chips on a breadboard and make a system that <strong>lets you program slightly longer programs</strong>.
Now you can program 30 instructions before going crazy.</p>
<h3 id="stage-2-bytes-and-7-segments">Stage 2: bytes and 7-segments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input: a row of 8 buttons + one &rsquo;enter&rsquo; button, I call it a &lsquo;piano keyboard&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Display: four 7-segment displays displaying four hex digits</li>
</ul>
<p>I should mention that I took the liberty of supplying myself with any discrete logic ICs I wanted, the most useful of which was the shift registers such as <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd74hct597.pdf">74HC597</a>.
They were the ones driving the system in the early stage when μCs (microcontrollers) programming was limited.</p>
<p>With the shifting and latching mechanism provided by the shfit registers, now I can push <em>8 bits at a time</em>, increasing typing speed.
And with the 7-segment hex display, I can see which instructions are being entered, greatly reducing the number of mistakes. Now, something more substantial can be made.</p>
<h3 id="stage-3-characters">Stage 3: characters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input: same</li>
<li>Display: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/255">16x2 Character LCD</a></li>
<li>Storage: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/525">Serial EEPROM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a stage when the system started to look more visibly like a computer.
Thanks to the more logic in the μCs, the content of the memory could be displayed on the LCD display and be browsed and edited in hex form.</p>
<p>Two programs are added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hex Editor - browse and edit the program instructions stored in an EEPROM IC.</li>
<li>Programmer - flash the stored program in the EEPROM onto the μC&rsquo;s memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to these two programs, the length of a program was no longer limited by the amount of patience I have in one programming session.
<strong>Separate routines could be edited at different times and combined into programs of arbitrary length.</strong></p>
<p>With this explosion of the capability of the system, it was time to go <em>symbolic</em>.</p>
<h3 id="stage-4-going-symbolic">Stage 4: going symbolic</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input: same</li>
<li>Display: same</li>
<li>Storage: same. I was using EEPROM packages like the floppy disks in early PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Up till this point, I was assemblying the binary with the help of my programmable scientific calculator and transcribing the result by hand.</p>
<p>I added two more programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text Editor - my version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)"><code>ed</code></a></li>
<li>AVR Assembler - assembling my (rudimentary) version of the AVR assembly language</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, no more transcribing binary by hand was needed. The system was self-sufficient.</p>
<p>I started putting together a picture of what my own toolchain should look like by the end of this project.
My toolchain was half complete at this point. (I don&rsquo;t finish it, tho.)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[text editor] - [compiler] - [assembler] - [linker] - [programmer]
- [system runtime]
</code></pre><p>I came to one realization: 8-bit programming is <em>limited</em>.
256 is a small value for a variable. I found myself keep reaching for the 16-bit operations while programming, and programming 16-bit operations with 8-bit instruction set is unwieldy.
The system <em>grew out of</em> 8-bit.</p>
