      <description>Project Gemini is an early NASA human spacefilght program.
The Gemini protocol is a new internet protocol that takes user privacy seriously.
I came across Gemini when I got distracted and was reading about the Gopher protocol. Gopher was interesting to me because I felt the modern web standards are too complicated. From the app developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, there are so many things you have to be aware of in order to have a website that uses good practices and also meets stakeholders&#39; tastes.</description>
