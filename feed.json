      "content_text": "This is a digital gas sensor (CCS811) and an LCD display (HD44780), controlled by Raspberry Pi, that I wired together back in 2019. The CS811 sensor reports two values: \u0026lsquo;equivalent carbon dioxide\u0026rsquo; (eCO2), and \u0026lsquo;Volatile Organic Compounds\u0026rsquo; (VOC), PPM. I am not too sure what those terms mean, not strong on chemistry, but nonetheless I wired it to display the reported values on LCD display continuously. I assume high values mean bad.",
