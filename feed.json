So I thought I\u0026rsquo;d use nbconvert instead to convert it to an HTML file and embed it in a post, and have a link on the post that goes to the full page version.",

I am not too sure what those terms mean, not strong on chemistry, but nonetheless I wired it to display the reported values on LCD display continuously. I assume high values mean bad.",
